Project created by Czar Ian Echavez
The project is a noughts and crosses game.

There are 2 ways to access the game, via the solution
or by accessing the executable directly. Both will work.


The executable can be accessed via:
FinalProject >> Debug >> FinalProject.exe


The solution file can be accessed via:
FinalProject >> FinalProject.sln

PLEASE DON'T MOVE THINGS AROUND.
BAD THINGS HAPPEN.


NOTE: This was my first time doing a solo project and at the time only had 6 months of experience programming. Please be gentle when reviewing this, I have feelings too.
